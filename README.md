# Welcome
This is my lecture notes during the second year, first semester at RUPP
where I learn mathematics. The whole document is written
in Khmer entirely. However, if you're interested reading 
this in English, you may visit my [notes](github.com/mengistic/notes)
repository, where I keep my personal notes there.

# Linear Algebra
This subject is taught by prof. Karim Ham.
